# DSPE3AH-RAT
FUD RAT written in python 


The DSPE3AH-RAT is a FUD Remote Access Tool, which bypasses every Antivirus. Even if the Rat gets uploaded to Virustotal it will be fud, because everyone gets a other version of the code. Also FUD as exe!

Functions:
+ screenshare (Remote Monitoring)
+ shell (Remote CMD)
+ sysinfo
+ keyblock_start/stop (Blocks/debloks Keyboard)
+ keylogger
+ download
+ help
+ persistence (Adds Key in registry)
+ exit
+ shutdown
+ reboot
+ cls (clears screen)
- I will add almost every other function you want.

Get it: Blackclone24@proton.me
Only for Legal Purposes... ;)
